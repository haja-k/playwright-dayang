    "response": "Thinking… (click to collapse) I will research the PCDS 2030 plan's social inclusivity goals. Key constraints include limited information on specific strategies. Missing info on Sarawakian demographics and current social issues. I’ve performed an information search and found the following: The PCDS 2030 plan aims to achieve social inclusivity for all Sarawakians by implementing various strategies and initiatives. Some of the specific initiatives outlined in the plan include: Increasing median monthly household income: The plan aims to increase the median monthly household income from RM4,500 in 2019 to RM15,000 by 2030, driven by higher job and entrepreneurial opportunities. Providing access to education and training: The plan emphasizes the importance of education and training in enhancing human capital and promoting social inclusivity. Initiatives such as the Endowment Fund Sarawak, Special Annual Grant for Early Childhood Education Institutions, and upskilling programs are aimed at providing access to quality education and training for all Sarawakians. Promoting affordable housing: The plan includes initiatives such as the Housing Deposit Assistance Scheme and Sarawak Rental Assistance Scheme to make housing more affordable and accessible to all Sarawakians, particularly those in the B40 and M40 income groups. Supporting vulnerable groups: The plan outlines initiatives such as the Bantuan Pesakit Buah Pinggang and Female Head of Household Assistance (KIRWaS) to support vulnerable groups, including those with kidney diseases and female-headed households. Fostering a caring society: The plan emphasizes the importance of promoting a caring society through initiatives such as the Community Social Intervention Centers (CSIC) and counseling services to support mental wellness and social welfare. These initiatives are designed to promote social inclusivity by providing access to education, training, and economic opportunities, as well as supporting vulnerable groups and fostering a caring society. By implementing these strategies, the PCDS 2030 plan aims to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all Sarawakians.",
