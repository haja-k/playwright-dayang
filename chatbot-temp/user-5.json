    "response": "Thinking… (click to collapse) I will research the PCDS 2030 plan for social inclusivity details. Key constraints include limited information on Sarawakians' needs. Missing info includes specific strategies for supporting inclusivity. I’ve performed an information search and found the following: The PCDS 2030 plan aims to achieve social inclusivity for all Sarawakians by implementing various strategies and initiatives. Some of the specific initiatives outlined in the plan include: Increasing median monthly household income: The plan aims to increase the median monthly household income from RM4,500 in 2019 to RM15,000 by 2030, driven by higher job and entrepreneurial opportunities. Providing access to education and training: The plan emphasizes the importance of education and training in enhancing human capital and promoting social inclusivity. Initiatives such as the Endowment Fund Sarawak, Special Annual Grant for Early Childhood Education Institutions, and Kenyalang Gold Card are aimed at supporting education and skills development. Promoting affordable housing: The plan includes initiatives such as the Housing Deposit Assistance Scheme (HDAS) and the Sarawak Rental Assistance Scheme (SRAS) to support affordable housing for low- and middle-income households. Supporting vulnerable groups: The plan outlines initiatives such as the Bantuan Pesakit Buah Pinggang (BPBP) and the Female Head of Household Assistance (KIRWaS) to support vulnerable groups, including those with kidney diseases and female-headed households. Enhancing public service delivery: The plan aims to enhance public service delivery through digitalization and the use of technology to improve access to services and reduce inequality. Fostering community development: The plan includes initiatives such as the Community Social Intervention Centers (CSIC) and the Integrated Sarawak Social Intervention and Community Support programmes to promote community development and social cohesion. These initiatives are designed to promote social inclusivity by addressing the needs of vulnerable groups, enhancing access to education and training, and promoting affordable housing and community development. By implementing these strategies, the PCDS 2030 plan aims to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all Sarawakians.
