    "response": "The fee for upgrading the registration class in the electrical field can vary based on the requirements and the authority overseeing the registration. To get the most accurate information, you should check with the relevant regulatory body or agency that manages electrical registrations in your area. For example, if you're looking to upgrade your registration with the Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission) in Malaysia, they usually provide a fee schedule on their official website. It would be best to visit their site or contact them directly for precise details.
