    "response": "Thinking… (click to collapse) I will research the PCDS 2030 plan for social inclusivity details. Key constraints include limited information on Sarawakian demographics. Missing info on specific strategies and initiatives for inclusivity. I’ve performed an information search and found the following: The PCDS 2030 plan aims to achieve social inclusivity for all Sarawakians by implementing various strategies and initiatives. Some of the key initiatives outlined in the plan include: Increasing median monthly household income: The plan aims to increase the median monthly household income from RM4,544 in 2019 to RM15,047 in 2030, driven by higher job and entrepreneurial opportunities. Providing access to education and training: The plan emphasizes the importance of education and training in enhancing human capital and promoting social inclusivity. Initiatives such as the Endowment Fund Sarawak, Special Annual Grant for Early Childhood Education Institutions, and Kenyalang Gold Card are aimed at supporting education and training for Sarawakians. Promoting affordable housing: The plan includes initiatives such as the Housing Deposit Assistance Scheme (HDAS) and the Sarawak Rental Assistance Scheme (SRAS) to support affordable housing for low- and middle-income households. Supporting vulnerable groups: The plan outlines initiatives such as the Bantuan Pesakit Buah Pinggang (BPBP) and the Female Head of Household Assistance (KIRWaS) to support vulnerable groups, including those with kidney diseases and female-headed households. Enhancing public service delivery: The plan emphasizes the importance of digital government and online services in enhancing public service delivery and promoting social inclusivity. These initiatives are designed to promote social inclusivity by providing access to education, training, and economic opportunities, as well as supporting vulnerable groups and enhancing public service delivery. By implementing these strategies, the PCDS 2030 plan aims to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all Sarawakians. My reasoning is based on the information provided in the PCDS 2030 plan, which outlines the vision, strategies, and initiatives for achieving social inclusivity in Sarawak. The plan emphasizes the importance of education, training, and economic opportunities in promoting social inclusivity, and outlines specific initiatives to support these goals.",
