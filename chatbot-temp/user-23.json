    "message": "I cant register my SarawakID bc it says that my IC has been registered before, what should i do",
    "response": "If you are unable to register your SarawakID because it says that your IC (Identity Card) has already been registered, it is possible that you or someone else has previously registered your IC. Here are a few steps you can take: Double-Check: Ensure that you have entered your IC number correctly. A simple typo could result in this message. Recover Account: If you might have previously registered and forgot, try recovering your account using any associated email or phone number. Contact Support: Reach out to the SarawakID support team for assistance. They can help you determine if there is already an account associated with your IC and guide you on how to proceed. Visit in Person: Go to a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter for in-person assistance. Bring your MyKad or passport for verification. Verify Your Identity: If the account is not verified, you might need to verify it through the appropriate channels, such as the Service Sarawak Counter, Kiosk, or through eKYC online. Taking these steps should help you resolve the issue with your SarawakID registration.",
