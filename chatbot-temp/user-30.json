    "response": "If you are receiving a message that your IC has been registered before, it likely means that there is already an existing SarawakID account associated with your IC number. Here are some steps you can take: Contact Support: Reach out to the SarawakID support team for assistance. They can help determine why your IC is showing as registered and help you resolve the issue. Visit a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter: You can visit a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter in person with your MyKad to get more information and assistance on this matter. Check for Previous Registration: Consider whether you might have registered previously and forgotten the details. If so, try using the \"Forgot Password\" option on the SarawakID login page to recover your account. Check for Errors: Double-check the information you are entering during registration to ensure there are no errors or typos that could be causing the issue. If none of these steps resolves the issue, contacting SarawakID support would be your best option to get personalized help.",
