    "response": "SarawakID is an individual account used for accessing services provided by the Sarawak government online. It serves as a personal identity for individuals using these services. SarawakID Corp, on the other hand, is a corporate account designed for companies or organizations to access and manage services specific to corporate entities. To register a SarawakID Corp account, you must first have a verified SarawakID individual account. The registration process involves providing corporate information, uploading necessary documents, and verifying the corporate email address. In summary, SarawakID is for individual use, while SarawakID Corp is for corporate or organizational use, with different registration and login processes.",
