    "response": "If you're unable to register for SarawakID because your IC has been registered before, it's likely that an account already exists under your identification number. Here are the steps you can take: Check if you have an existing account: Try to recall if you have previously registered for SarawakID. You might have an old account that you forgot about. Password Recovery: If you remember having an account but forgot the credentials, try the password recovery option on the SarawakID login page. Contact Support: If you're sure you haven't registered before or can't access an existing account, contact SarawakID support or visit a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter. They can assist in resolving issues related to your IC being registered. Bring Identification: If visiting a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter, bring your MyKad or passport for verification. These steps should help you resolve the issue with your SarawakID registration.",
