    "response": "Thinking… (click to collapse) I will research the PCDS 2030 plan for social inclusivity details. Key constraints include limited information on the plan's specifics. Assuming the plan is publicly available, I'll outline its strategies. I’ve performed an information search and found the following: The PCDS 2030 plan aims to achieve social inclusivity for all Sarawakians by promoting equal opportunities for participation in the state's overall development and ensuring equitable distribution of wealth through jobs and business opportunities. To support this goal, several strategies and initiatives are outlined, including: Increasing median monthly household income: The plan aims to increase the median monthly household income from RM4,500 in 2019 to RM15,000 by 2030, driven by higher job and entrepreneurial opportunities. Improving access to education and skills training: The plan emphasizes the importance of education and skills training in enhancing social inclusivity, with initiatives such as the repair of dilapidated schools and the provision of training programs. Promoting affordable housing: The plan includes initiatives such as the Housing Deposit Assistance Scheme (HDAS) and the Sarawak Rental Assistance Scheme (SRAS) to support affordable housing for low- and middle-income households. Supporting vulnerable groups: The plan includes initiatives such as the Female Head of Household Assistance (KIRWaS) and the Bantuan Pesakit Buah Pinggang (BPBP) to support vulnerable groups, including single mothers, female-headed households, and individuals with kidney diseases. Enhancing public service delivery: The plan aims to enhance public service delivery through digitalization, with initiatives such as the Digital Government initiative, to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public services. These strategies and initiatives are designed to promote social inclusivity and reduce poverty and inequality in Sarawak, ensuring that all Sarawakians have access to opportunities and resources to improve their socio-economic well-being. My reasoning is based on the information provided in the retrieved context, which outlines the PCDS 2030 plan's goals and strategies for achieving social inclusivity. By analyzing the plan's initiatives and programs, I have identified the key strategies outlined to support social inclusivity, including increasing median monthly household income, improving access to education and skills training, promoting affordable housing, supporting vulnerable groups, and enhancing public service delivery.",
