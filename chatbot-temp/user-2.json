    "response": "Thinking… (click to collapse) I will research the PCDS 2030 plan for social inclusivity details. Key constraints include limited information on Sarawakian needs. Missing info includes specific PCDS 2030 initiatives for inclusivity. I’ve performed an information search and found the following: The PCDS 2030 plan aims to achieve social inclusivity for all Sarawakians by implementing various strategies and initiatives. Some of the specific initiatives outlined in the plan include: Bantuan Khas Sarawakku Sayang (BKSS): A package of assistance amounting to RM6.7 billion, which includes cash assistance, discounts on utility bills, fee waivers, and deferment of payment for land premiums and loan schemes. Endowment Fund Sarawak (EFS): A grant of RM1,000 for every Sarawakian baby born starting from 2019, to assist with higher education, starting a career, or as seed capital for small businesses. Special Annual Grant for Early Childhood Education Institutions: A grant of RM5,000 for Early Childhood Education Institutions registered in Sarawak, to provide quality care and education. Kenyalang Gold Card: A special card for Sarawak senior citizens aged 60 and above, providing facilities such as special discounts, free membership, and other benefits. Bantuan Pesakit Buah Pinggang: Assistance for kidney patients, covering costs such as AV fistula insertion, Erythropoietin injections, and hemodialysis treatments. Launching Grants for Entrepreneurs: A launching grant of RM5,000 for entrepreneurs, particularly those from welfare aid recipient groups. Female Head of Household Assistance (KIRWaS): Assistance of RM500 for single mothers and female heads of households from disadvantaged groups. Affordable Housing: Initiatives such as the Rumah Spektra Permata (RSP) scheme, which provides affordable housing units for the B40 and M40 groups. Housing Deposit and Repayment Assistance Scheme (HDRAS): A scheme providing financial assistance for first-time homebuyers, covering 10% of the house purchase price, up to a maximum of RM10,000. Sarawak Rental Assistance Scheme (SRAS): A scheme providing monthly rental assistance of RM200 for eligible tenants, aimed at easing the living burden of Sarawakians who work and rent in major districts. These initiatives aim to support the social inclusivity goal by providing assistance to vulnerable groups, promoting affordable housing, and enhancing access to education and economic opportunities. My reasoning is based on the information provided in the PCDS 2030 plan, which outlines these specific strategies and initiatives to support social inclusivity. By implementing these measures, the plan aims to promote a more equitable and inclusive society for all Sarawakians.",
