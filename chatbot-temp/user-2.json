    "response": "If you're unable to register your SarawakID because it says your IC has been registered before, it's possible that your information is already associated with an existing account. Here are a few steps you could take: Check for an Existing Account: Try to recall if you have previously registered for a SarawakID. If you have, attempt to log in using any email or phone number you might have used. Contact Support: If you're certain you haven't registered before, or if you can't access an existing account, contact SarawakID support for assistance. They may be able to provide more information or help resolve the issue. Visit a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter: You can also visit a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter to inquire about the registration issue in person. Bring your MyKad or passport with you for verification purposes. These steps should help you resolve the issue with your SarawakID registration.",
