    "message": "I cant register my SarawakID bc it says that my IC has been registered before, what should i do",
    "response": "If you're receiving a message that your IC (identity card) has already been registered for SarawakID, it indicates that an account associated with your IC number already exists. Here's what you can do: Check for Existing Account: Verify if you or someone else has previously registered a SarawakID account using your IC number. You might have created an account earlier and forgotten about it. Password Recovery: If you suspect you might have an account, try recovering the password using the \"Forgot Password\" option on the SarawakID login page. This might help you regain access if you have an existing account. Contact Support: If you are sure you have not registered before, contact SarawakID support or visit a Service Sarawak Counter or Kiosk for assistance. They can help you resolve issues related to duplicate registrations and verify your identity to clear up any problems. Visit Service Sarawak: Consider visiting a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter in person with your MyKad for further assistance. They can provide more detailed help and verify your registration status. These steps should help you resolve the issue with your SarawakID registration.",
