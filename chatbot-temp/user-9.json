    "response": "Thinking… (click to collapse) I will research the PCDS 2030 plan's social inclusivity goals. Key constraints include limited information on Sarawakian demographics. Missing info on specific initiatives and strategies is assumed. I’ve performed an information search and found the following: The PCDS 2030 plan aims to achieve social inclusivity for all Sarawakians by increasing median monthly household income from RM4,544 in 2019 to RM15,047 in 2030, driven by higher job and entrepreneurial opportunities. To support this goal, several strategies and initiatives are outlined: Education and Human Capital Development: The plan emphasizes the importance of education in achieving social inclusivity. Initiatives such as the repair of dilapidated schools and the development of technical and vocational training programs aim to improve access to quality education and enhance human capital. Affordable Housing: The Sarawak Government has implemented various schemes to provide affordable housing, including the Rumah Spektra Permata (RSP) program, which offers housing units at prices ranging from RM50,000 to RM160,000. Additionally, the Housing Deposit Assistance Scheme (HDAS) and the Housing Deposit and Repayment Assistance Scheme (HDRAS) provide financial assistance to first-time homebuyers. Social Welfare Programs: The plan includes initiatives such as the Female Head of Household Assistance (KIRWaS) program, which provides cash assistance to female-headed households, and the Bantuan Pesakit Buah Pinggang (BPBP) program, which assists kidney patients with treatment costs. Community Development: The plan emphasizes the importance of community development in achieving social inclusivity. Initiatives such as the Community Social Intervention Centers (CSIC) program and the Integrated Sarawak Social Intervention and Community Support program aim to provide support to vulnerable groups and promote community well-being. Digital Inclusion: The plan recognizes the importance of digital inclusion in achieving social inclusivity. Initiatives such as the Sarawak Linking Urban, Rural, and Nation (SALURAN) program aim to improve digital connectivity and provide access to digital services, particularly in rural areas. These strategies and initiatives aim to promote social inclusivity by addressing the needs of vulnerable groups, improving access to education and economic opportunities, and enhancing community well-being. By implementing these initiatives, the PCDS 2030 plan aims to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all Sarawakians.",
