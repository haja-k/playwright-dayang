    "response": "If you are unable to register your SarawakID because your IC has been registered before, it is likely that your IC is already associated with an existing account. Here are some steps you can take: Check for an Existing Account: Ensure that you have not previously registered for a SarawakID. If you have, try logging in using your existing credentials. Reset Password: If you have forgotten your login details, attempt to reset your password using the registered email or phone number linked to your IC. Contact Support: If you are certain that you haven't registered before and the issue persists, contact SarawakID support for assistance. They can provide further guidance on resolving the issue. Visit Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter: You may also visit a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter in person for assistance. Bring your MyKad for verification and help with the registration issue.",

    "response": "Based on the context provided, the gas bill with the account number 056-G2299 from Sarawak Gas Distribution Sdn. Bhd. (SGAS) appears to be valid. However, the electricity bill associated with Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB) and the account number 201166495100 doesn't clearly indicate it's valid for SEB. You might want to double-check the account number for the electricity bill to ensure it matches the format used by SEB. You can refer to a sample electricity bill from SEB here for comparison. If the account number does not match the typical format or if you continue to have doubts, consider contacting SEB directly for verification. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with!",
