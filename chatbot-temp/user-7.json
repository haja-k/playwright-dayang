    "response": "If you are receiving a message that your IC has been registered before, it likely means that there is already an account associated with your IC number. Here are a few steps you can take: Check for Previous Registration: Try to recall if you have previously registered for SarawakID using your IC. If you have, attempt to log in using that account. Password Recovery: If you remember registering but have forgotten your login credentials, use the password recovery or reset option on the SarawakID login page. Contact Support: If you are certain you haven't registered before and are facing this issue, you should contact SarawakID support or visit a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter for assistance. They can help you verify and resolve any registration issues. Visit a Service Sarawak Counter: Bringing your MyKad with you, you can visit a Service Sarawak Kiosk or Counter in person for assistance with registration or to resolve any discrepancies. These steps should help you address the issue with registering your SarawakID.",
